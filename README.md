# Reusability of Horrorgame Features for Unreal Engine Blueprint (UE 5.3.2)

This project was programmed as part of my bachelor's thesis for October 2024. It contains reusable horror game features developed in Blueprint.

These codes are modular and can be reused in another project.

The following features have been developed in the project:

Light detection
Jump scares via trigger boxes (3D model and widget)
AI that chases the player and triggers a jump scare upon collision
